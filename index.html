<h2><b>Short Bio</b></h2>

<p>
Jia Xue is Assistant Professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and the Faculty of Information (iSchool). She received her Ph.D. in Social Welfare from School of Social Policy and Practice, University of Pennsylvania in 2018, along with a dual master's degree in Statistics from Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in 2016, and Law degree from Tsinghua University Law School (China) in 2011. She took her research fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School of Government from 2016 to 2018.<br>


Jia's research focuses on applying computational and big data approaches to examine various facets of intimate partner violence and sexual assault. At a time when there is an ongoing public discussion about the responsible use of big data, her role will inspire students in both the Faculties of Social Work and Information to reflect on how big data can be used to promote social justice in innovative ways. Jia's research agenda extends to the international context, specifically in China. Her article "Rape Myths and the Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale in China," published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, provides the first psychometric measure to assess attitudes about rape in China. Her research also has been published in scholarly journals such as Child Abuse & Neglect, American Journal of Public Health, and British Journal of Social Work.
